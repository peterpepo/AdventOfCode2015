I was curious, whether topaz (Eric Wastl) - AdventOfCode author is trying to tell us something.

For this reason I decided to create heat-maps (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_map) for each solution (part A, part B).
I used plotly library (https://plot.ly/) in it's basic form.

For more information, check the website mentioned, namely https://plot.ly/python/heatmaps/ for heatmap.

In order to draw the map, I used instructions from puzzle in [x;y] format.
